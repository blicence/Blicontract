## 🔐 Security Features

### Access Control
```solidity
// Multi-level authorization
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
    require(authorizedCallers[msg.sender], "Caller not authorized");
    _;
}

modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");
    _;
}
```

### Emergency Controls
```solidity
// Pausable functionality for emergency stops
function pause() external onlyOwner {
    _pause();
}

function unpause() external onlyOwner {
    _unpause();
}
```

### Upgrade Safety
```solidity
// UUPS upgradeable pattern with authorization
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) 
    internal 
    override 
    onlyOwner 
{}
```
